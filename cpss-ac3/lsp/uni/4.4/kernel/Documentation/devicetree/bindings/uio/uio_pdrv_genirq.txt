This file describes the changes done to the uio_pdrv_genirq driver, along with
the new device-tree properties required to control these features.

Added properties:

- uio-name: Holds the name of the created uio device.
In case this property exists, then it will be used as the uio device name
(/sys/class/uio/uioN/name), in case it's not defined, the driver will use
the node's name as the uio device name.

Example:
	dma_xor@6a0000 {
        	compatible = "marvell,mv-xor-v2";
		reg = <0x6a0000 0x1000>,
	              <0x6b0000 0x1000>;
		musdk-mode;
        	uio-name = "uio_dma_xor_4";
	        status = "okay";
	};
