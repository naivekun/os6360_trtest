* PCI end point UIO driver

This driver implements a generic UIO device that
configures a PCIe end-point and exposes it's resources
to user space

Mandatory properties:

- compatible:  marvell,pci-ep-uio
- reg: a list of named memory spaces to configure to the BARs and host.
       if the base address of a BAR equals 0, a RAM back-end will be
       allocated for the BAR.
- reg-names: accepts "bar0","bar1",.."bar5" and "host-map"
- device-id: The device id to configure in the PCI header
- class_code: The class code to configure in the PCI header
- subclass_code: The sub class code to configure in the PCI header

Example:
The example below creates a NIC endpoint (class 0x2 sub-class 0x0) with
a 1MB BAR-0 backed by RAM and maps 4GB of the host memory space
at address 0x80_0000_0000

pci-ep-uio {
	compatible = "marvell,pci-ep-uio";
	reg = <0 0 0 0x100000>, <0x80 0x00000000 0x1 0x000000000>;
	reg-names = "bar0", "host-map";
	device-id = <0x7080>;
	class-code = <0x2>;
	subclass-code = <0x0>;
	status = "okay";
};
