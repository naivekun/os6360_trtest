* Marvell EBU AHCI SATA Controller

Marvell EBU AHCI SATA Controller belongs to platform AHCI SATA
Controller; for more detailed about platform AHCI, please refer
to "ahci-platform.txt".

Required properties:
- compatible        : compatible string, one of:
  - "marvell,armada-380-ahci"
  - "marvell,armada-3700-ahci"
  - "marvell,armada-cp110-ahci"
- interrupts        : <interrupt mapping for SATA IRQ>
- reg               : <registers mapping>

Optional properties in addition to platform AHCI:
- "marvell,led-gpio"          : the GPIO which controlls LED state
- "marvell,blink-policy"      : LED blinking policy - 0 the LED is not activated on activity
                                                      1 the LED blinks on every 10ms when activity is detected.
                                                      2 the LED is on when idle, and blinks off every 10ms when activity is detected.
LED Blinking:
Marvell EBU AHCI SATA Controller supports software activity LED
blinking through a GPIO with the optional properties of "marvell,led-gpio"
and "marvell,blink-policy". The software activity LED blinking only
works when the SATA disk is connected to the controller directly,
so the 2 optional properties should not be set when a PMP card is
attached to the controller and disks are connected to the PMP card.

Example for armada 3720 DB:
        sata@e0000 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-ahci";
		reg = <0xe0000 0x178>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 27 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&nb_periph_clk 1>;
		target-supply = <&reg_5v_sata>;
		phys = <&a3700_comphy 2 COMPHY_SATA0>;
		marvell,led-gpio = <&gpionb 11 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		marvell,blink-policy = <BLINK_OFF>;
		status = "okay";
	};

Example for armada 8040 DB:
	cp0_sata: sata@540000 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-cp110-ahci";
		reg = <0x540000 0x30000>;
		dma-coherent;
		interrupts = <ICU_GRP_NSR 107 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&cp0_syscon0 1 15>;
		comreset_u = <0x17>;
		comwake = <0x6>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		sata-port@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			phys = <&cp0_comphy 1 COMPHY_SATA0>;
			phy-names = "comphy";
		};
		sata-port@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			phy-names = "comphy";
			status = "okay";
		};
	};
