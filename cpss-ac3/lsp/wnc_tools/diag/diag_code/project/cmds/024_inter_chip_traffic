NAME
       $prog_name - traffic across two switch chips with two
                                internal ports a loop

SYNOPSIS
       $prog_name [-d duration] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       The command is a traffic tester for internal ports. It will group two
       internal ports a loop and generate the traffic flow in each loop. The
       amount of packets sent are designed to nearly reach the line rate of the
       port. After reaching the test timeout, the command will retrieve packets
       for each port and check contents to determine whether they are correctly
       delivered and received.

       Parameter \"-d\" is to set the running duration of traffic flow from send-
       ing out packets to capturing packets, including the environment setup
       time. However, the execution time of the command will also include the
       time of analyzing received packets, which is correlated to the number of
       internal ports that the DUT has and the number of packets we send.    

MANDATORY OPTIONS
       At least one optional option is needed.

OPTIONAL OPTIONS
       -d    Duration between starting to send packets and stopping the traffic
             flow. Acceptable value is from 10 to 86400 seconds.  

       -h    Show this help message.

PASS CRITERIA
       - Test internal ports with two ports a loop:
           SUCCESS: all internal ports send and receive packets correctly
             Display: \"Result: PASS\" with traffic rates and Tx/Rx packet counts
                      of ports that are tested
             Return code : 0

           ERROR: any inter-port fails to send, or receives packets incorrectly
             Display: \"Result: FAIL\" with further messages like
                      \"FAIL: Get MAC link-down on port i1!\"
                      or
                      \"FAIL: Not got packet# 1 that CPU injects to port i1\"
                      \"FAIL: Packet checking failed on port i1\"
             Return code : 1
